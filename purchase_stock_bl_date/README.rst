This module adds B/L Date fields to the purchase order and the picking.  B/L Date assigned
in the purchase receipt is used for capturing the currency rate for the unit price
calculation, which is the basis of inventory valuation.

Note that this module only adjusts the logic where currency rate is captured.
Adjusting the date of stock moves or journal entries is outside the scope of this module.

Background:
~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on the incoterms of the purchase transaction in international trades, the
ownership transfer of the purchased products takes place before they arrive at the
domestic warehouse (i.e. when products are loaded in cargo in the origin country), while
the receipt operation in Odoo, for practical reasons, have to be done when the products
are received at the warehouse.  This results in an inaccurate valuation of the inventory,
which should be avoided.

Usage
=====

* Set B/L Date in the purchase order as appropriate. When the purchase order is confirmed and
  the receipt picking is generated, the set date is passed over to the corresponding field of the picking.
* Adjust B/L Date of the receipt picking as necessary before validating the receipt.

In case you forget to assign or need to change the B/L Date after the receipts have been
validated, follow these steps:

* Open the Receipts form and click on the "Unlock" button.
* Enable the 'Force B/L Date' option and add or update the B/L Date.
* After updating, click on the "Lock" button to update the inventory valuation and
  the corresponding Stock Journal Entry.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

At present, this module does not address situations in which purchased inventory has already been shipped 
to customers when users attempt to modify the B/L date. 
This can potentially result in discrepancies in inventory valuation between the received and shipped value, 
especially for products employing FIFO and AVCO costing methods.
